      "question": "In the \"House Robber II\" problem, why can't the robber steal from both the first and last houses?",
      "options": [
        "A) The houses are too far apart.",
        "B) There's not enough money in those houses.",
        "C) The problem states that only one house can be robbed.",
        "D) The first and last houses are considered adjacent in a circular arrangement."

      "question": "What is the primary data structure used to represent the amount of money in each house?",
      "options": [
        "A) Linked List",
        "B) Binary Tree",
        "C) Integer Array",
        "D) Hash Table"

      "question": "The video's solution involves two loops. What is the fundamental difference in how they iterate through the houses?",
      "options": [
        "A) One loop uses recursion, the other iteration.",
        "B) One loop starts from index 0, the other from index 1, to handle the circularity constraint.",
        "C) One loop calculates the maximum robbery amount including the first house, the other excludes it.",
        "D) One loop uses a dynamic programming approach, the other a greedy approach."

      "answer": "C"

      "question": "If the input `nums` is `[1, 3, 1, 5]`, what is the maximum amount of money the robber can steal without triggering the alarm?",
      "options": [
        "A) 5",
        "B) 6",
        "C) 7",

      "answer": "B"

    {
      "question": "The video mentions using variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` to track maximum robbery amounts.  What is the core logic behind updating these variables in each loop?",
      "options": [
        "A)  They use a complex mathematical formula to determine the optimal robbery strategy.",
        "B) They randomly select houses to maximize the stolen amount.",
        "C) They compare the maximum amount robbed so far (either including or excluding the current house) and update accordingly.",
        "D) They use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible robbery combinations."
