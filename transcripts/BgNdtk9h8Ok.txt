So basic Kaibar college University may exam basic competitive exam mainly ata convert kara token first token main are you getting the point then fifth this is what I comment 11 12, 13, 14 in tire 6a 7 equal to 8 vala uskevadi mera 20 johavo 920 comma separator b identifier equal to 30 constant literal separator if that is what 15th, 16, 17, 18, 1920 getting the point fit 21 mera return 22, 23, 24, 25 getting the point so 25, 26, 27, 28, 93031 and 3232 tokens johavo in kuap chahi is 3k show karo tokens let's say core question competitive exam same question tokenization cuper question separator again braces on Ogi two important point guys double commas mirror start over here Comma K under jitney value in a Kaibar Student Isco Count Karlithe 9 Isco Count Nikarna Double commas K under Apka is pure single count Karthiya Malabam longest string Tupper Jay to longest string single Token Otherwise Answer 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th Getting the point 10 tokens Lexical analysis phase or point or not finite automata this is a actually application of the DFA and NFA finite automatic key application which machine we use DFA or nfa Finite automata simply can be used for defining the tokens thank you.
