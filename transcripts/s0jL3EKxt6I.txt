So hey everyone, welcome back. Welcome to another exciting video and AI agent Now open source tool complex agentic workflow just by dragging and dropping and I was really amazed. Open source secondly, I mean it was really, really, really amazing to see this. And so let's deep dive into this particular tool. I'm sure, I'm sure. Basically AI agents just by drag and drop workflows and all that stuff. This is very important because this tool is amazing. AI agent. AI agent. Okay, then you will understand. Okay, so let's understand AI agent. Let's say open AI call so open AI basically API server. API server or API server input. So let's say user input or user input or system prompt Correct system prompt so let's say system prompt now this particular thing talks to an LLM join API server now is LLM context number one pre trained data which is never real time this is very important. Yay. Particular data 2023 updated Hoga 2024 pre trained data here okay plus ISCO context as a system prompt system prompt context input context plus Jobi user context now based on this generate generative pre trained transformer basis Generate or generate output Typical working now problem number one pre trained data Real time data just speeds a world move It's a old data Everyone needs something real time Number one secondly context and third action if you really think about it, text input or a text output it takes an input and gives an output Personalized responses K Current weather data fetch Karakta user key location kofetch Karakta Wahanka weather temperature kah weather conditions flights system can the login flights book Karakta Anyway this is very important I mean same thing now for example, what is day today? What is day today? Real time data that today is 3-7-2020 personalized response today is 3-7-NOW context feed as a system prompt System prompt context kyoga cost badegi and there is a high chance K up input output token say Baharchalaja ticket to error let's say user weather details K Analyze analyze User analyze analyze analyze weather data interact real time weather details user mangra oga my system prompt Mesko bhatabidunga available tools weather calling a tool respond smartly by Merkopna City Batao LLM user is function or many return let's say 27 degrees Celsius hey, looks like that weather in your city is 27 degrees Celsius user NLP natural language or mere functions similarly let's say. Let's say fine tuned model let's say fine tuned Model you know coding related tweets generate basically Mary profile trending topic get trending topic trending topics trending topics or is model name mere is function could call kia kit tweet kurdo tweet oga fervapis return who are response and basically ache mere LLM model smartly Internet external LM model system can that integrate similarly similarly for example let's say let's say this is not open AI Claudia Ferric lama model is this tweet safe controversial similarly let's say coding may usually claude is good latest trends input is security value model K similarly let's say abuser always okay that always post data or always post tweets about JS only I don't want to post something about rust instructions available tools based on that functions context you can see complex pipeline build over here so that means AI agentic workflow knowledge LLMs under context functions security data flow handle karna so AI agent banana so yes pipeline right you basically take all these different different components or up in co integrated way make pipeline agentic workflow agentic workflow context because particular rule context right doesn't make sense weather details relevant memories got it. There's a lot of overhead that comes but but netmet you got the context AI agent AI agent LLM bought dumb cheese to real functionality workflow so I hope you got the context AI agentic workflow security recursive manner multimodal applications right? Agent LLM for example deep seq use could be LLM use you chat with it and response or smart banana agent workflow banana for example context information extract karna information so you're saying that basically that is basically an agentic workflow AI agentic workflow you have two ways pipeline and this tool is really amazing and sponsored video open source and let's see. Let's do a sign in a quick sign in so you can see that namespace and you can see one what you can do is let's say workflow AI agentic workflow workflow drag and drop workflows. For example let's say bare minimum first step trigger workflow let's say user chat message user chat message allow file upload chat message okay first note agent correct. You can see actions in app data transformations flow core human in loop interruptions interruptions and all. Anyway what is thing is Message Simple Open AI call Basic LLM chain for example LLMs Correct memory or back and forth correct hello message so I'll just say connected this thing chat input correct which is fine open Chat hello there okay yeah now I am getting see Tumhari is particular node input previous node message chat input input hello there Basically chat input first thing is cleared AI agent right you can see that providers and like anthropic Azure AWS bedrock so deep seek use so let's go with OpenAI because you're going to configure Karaka so OpenAI OpenAI OpenAI take OpenAI account model use GPT4O main is fine and yeah, this is fine you can see a chat model sub node must be connected I think everything is cool okay or meripas that system helpful assistant hello, how can I assist you today? Simple floor you didn't had nothing when chat message is received AI agent open that's fine. This is fine System message could be change of course so system message system message you are an helpful assistant that is fine. Okay that's fine. Redis chart memory postgres window buffer is basically meaning window buffer Karl to session ID Basically that is fine and model right you can see chart message so what you will see is window buffer memory memory notes existing load memory and first input how can I assist you today? And save context input hello, you are this, you are this so you can see that let's say agent context provide karna this is very important as an AI agent real time data for example, what is weather like today Technically similarly technically in k pass context nahihota okay, like what is date today Correct in kpas build kulbi context so what I can do is now this is very interesting. Very very interesting. They got tools let's say to write a tool in JS let's say date return let's say so what I can do is like date tool value should be alpha okay date as a date underscore tool Call this tool X Again the input should be string okay, Call this tool to get a second Call this tool to get the current date okay provide okay the use this function takes no input this function takes no input and returns the date as string Basically query I don't know example convert the incoming query to the uppercase that is good. You can access the input value tools via query. The returned value should be this simple. New date.new date ticket.function inspect element open karthi because unwanted errors new date ticket new date he return directly this is good so new date two string ticket so new date dot to string new date dot two string okay input schema so this is I think good enough. What is date today? Let's see what happens or Today date is March 7th this is. Let's say hi, how are you function call technically right? Because you can see mirror function called naiva similarly similarly tools already behave external tools and all that stuff but custom code because HTTP request data in fact correct that is also a nice use case, no? So what you can see is execute query, insert or update select something update something postgres data as a context feed Karpai correct So chat assistant and not only that they go Jabiya Pura agent boss smart agent let's say because many account configured but you can see basically input correct so if I click on this so yahape previous nodes right? So I can just say that hi guys hi guys and basically hi guys I'm just a program but I am here ready to help you this is this basically credentials what is date today? What is date today? Today is this thing hi guys Today date is 7th March 1795 if you need anything else, feel free to ask simple 3k same full flow input do something processing output input a full agent and subsequent coding right? Tools or seamless tool and it is open source I mean open source essay tool open source or it's not something new language type script so understanding maybe easy it's not something like so I would highly highly highly recommend essay code basis this is very important okay Abdiktin that Kama ASAI tool KUD banasakto agar Muja Kutte systems or bull MQ is really nice Triggers triggers processors technical house method engineering and let's say output nodes up Technically user user trigger define KAR let's say input chat message TK what simple object oriented nodes Basically class node or basically input letter string later so let's say Jabi node initializes as a string whatsoever input chart message processor function run processor function Technically running trigger is trigger her node key let's say ID hair one processors basically joby or jobi is next node user processor function job let's say AI agent complex Q mechanism design first node as a trigger dialogue automatically run kartach this is how these systems work High level viewer how you can build your own zapier is kind of like a zapier this is really really really powerful because AI agents engineering overhead how to build AI agents I'll prepare a series using lang graph lang chin or or be bossari tools But I hope you got the idea what we are trying to do here so this was all about this particular video I hope your video informative agent actually may I dump LLM AI or agent security retrieval process multimodal agent Banajata just in case. But I think it is going to be worth it. So let me know what do you think about this particular video? And video. Until then, bye bye and take care.
