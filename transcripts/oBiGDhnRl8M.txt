Hello and welcome Those to the 5 minute engineering. GSM Architecture Global System for mobile communication architecture. See they Kampe architecture front end Ekobolo middle logic last one back end front end or back end Computer engineers front end, middle logic and back end front end components. Mobile station. Mobile station. You know this is the Ms. This is the mobile station that is you know. Now this mobile station is getting connected to your middle logic components. BTS is a BSSK component. What is bts? This is the base Trans receiver station. Base transfer Trans receiver station to a station transmit signal. Transmit or receive BTS simple region, Car tower local region. Remember is BTS Mobile stations connected Mobile stations or yay communicate. Communicate. So that is nothing but the signals that are being provided by BTSC tower provider. Okay, so relation in between Ms. And bts. Okay, this is what is happening. Now remember remember BSS does consist of many BTs. See BTs does consist of many BTS but a single BSE base station subsystem Base station subsystem control Karnavala coordinate Karnavala maintain Karnavala component that is a bsc. Okay, BSC Matlab mobile station controller Controller coordinate Karthi. So what, what BSC is doing? See BTS is nothing but like a child coordinated Ran maintain or physique, you know flexible Banarai. You know what I'm trying to say is that coordination maintained Mobile station directly MSC that is mobile switching center call switching function. Call switching. MSC is a very crucial component of nss. NSS network and switching subsystem Network and switching subsystem major component msc. It is like a grandparent, grandparent MSC hair parent, BSC or children hierarchical order. Okay, or remember back end middle logic and front end. Back end front end Mobile station or bts. Remember mobile station or BTS is connected by an interface called as a UM interface. It is a UM interface AIR interface BTS or BSC within bss. BTS or BSC interface. This is nothing but abyss interface abs okay and very important third interface. BSC or MSC interface interface interface explanation videos so this was about the GSM architecture Hari component Bare Asan Bashame Apnea Explanation Magical Jesus. 5 Minute in Jenny Co subscribe Karna Bilkulan Hulega Thanks a lot those two for watching this video.
